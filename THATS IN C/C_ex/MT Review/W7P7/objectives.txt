You are given:
1) a tab delimited employee.txt file
2) pre-defined struct to represent a employee called LinkedEmployee

Complete the following functions:
1) get_employees
2) index_employees
3) link_employees
4) print_supervisory_chain
5) free_memory

get_employees:
given a char[] filename, returns an array of employees* in the form of LinkedEmployee**
Make this array of LinkedEmployee* MAX_COUNT in length so it has enough space to store all employees. 
You do not need to populate the "struct Employee* supervisor" attribute yet, but do populate all others.

index_employees: 
given an array of employees in the form of LinkedEmployee**, returns an indexed array of employees*, indexed_employees, such that indexed_employees[i] points to the employee with id of i

link_employees
given a full list of employee and the employee_index
populate the "struct Employee* supervisor" attribute of all the employees (unless if they have an invalid or no supervisor).

print_supervisory_chain
see Sample.PNG 
hint: use recursion 

free memory
given a full list of employee and the employee_index as inputs
This function will completely free up memory used by these 2 structures.
You main should run valgrind clean after you complete this function.
