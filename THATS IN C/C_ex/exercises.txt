==== ESC190 Week 8/9 Exercises ====

(1) Convert the following base-10 (decimal) numbers to their binary and hexadecimal representations.
(Hint: figure out how many bits you will need first)
124
234
1987
3456
40
90
-------------
(2) Create the following files:

week8.h
week8.c

..Fill the contents of week8.h with:
- necessary includes
- function declarations for the functions defined in week8.c
- a struct declaration for a doubly linked list (Q: what should the members be?)
- a struct declaration for a doubly linked list node (Q: what should the members be?)

..Fill the contents of week8.c with:
function definitions for functions which:
- delete the node at index i
- insert a node at index i
- delete an entire doubly linked list

..Compile your code (Q: what flags will you use? Try -Wall, -g)
..Run the executable and ensure that it runs valgrind clean.

Note: consider implementing this for a singly linked list first.
-------------
(3) Implement a queue using the code from part (2). How would you test that this works?
-------------
(4) Consider the hash table with chaining presented in lecture. In preparation for lab 4, assume you are given a hash function and
a number of keys int n, number of buckets int b.

..How would you perform the following operations in C? If each of the following is a function, what are the types of
the input arguments and return values?

- create a new hash table with b buckets
- insert a key into the associated bucket without a collision occuring
- insert a key into the associated bucket with a collision occuring, with linked-list chaining
- deleting the hash table (with no memory leaks or valgrind errors)

..Look up the "trivial hash function". Hash the following keys using the trivial hash function:
- "CATCAT"
- "DOG!!!"
- "LOVEESC190"
- "CISCOOL"

(Hint: Use the ASCII table and part 1 of this exercise)
